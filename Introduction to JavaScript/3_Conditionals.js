### What are Conditional Statements? ###

If-else decisions can be modeled in code by creating conditionals statements. A conditional
statement checks a specific condition(s) and performs a task based on the condition(s).

We will be covering the following concepts:

1. if, else if, and else statements
2. comparison operators
3. logical operators
4. truthy vs falsy values
5. ternary operators
6. switch statement

### If Statement ###

We often perform a task based on a condition. In programming, we can also perform a task based on
a condition using an if statement. The if statement is composed of:

1. The if keyword followed by a set of parentheses () which is followed by a code block, or block
statement, indicated by a set of curly braces {}.
2. Inside the parentheses (), a condition is provided that evaluates to true or false.
3. If the condition evaluates to true, the code inside the curly braces {} runs, or executes.
